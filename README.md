# carbon

A simple Vulkan abstraction which still gives the user a lot of
control while removing a lot of boilerplate. It supports creating
Acceleration Structures and using the Vulkan ray tracing pipeline.
It bases on VMA and vk-bootstrap to simplify the functionality even
more. However, it is not ready to use yet and has a lot of missing
and implicit functionality.

Additionally, it implements NVIDIA Aftermath to generate crash reports
with a lot of helpful information.
